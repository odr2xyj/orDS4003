Dashboard building process:

In this project, I learned a lot about interactive apps and using Plotly and Dash in Python.

  Over the course of this semester, I expanded my knowledge of Dash and interactive apps in general. One of the hardest units for me was implementing call-back functions into my app. This app served as a real experiment of learning how to make my app completely interactive and utilize callbacks to do so. My app features 3 sliders and a radio button that all changes the selected data based on the demographics selected. Ensuring that the callbacks worked for all my graphs and plots was a challenge, but very satisfying in the end.
  Plotly allowed me to create visually appealing graphs and charts in order to allow my data to be visualized for the user. I implemented a multi-variable bar graph, two pie charts, and three box plots. All of these figures were adjusted to the filtered dataset selection. 
  In my finishing touches, I incorporated a NavBar that links to my GitHub and a link to the original data file. Also, I made lines telling the user how many data rows are in their filtered data. This overall brought the interactivity to a functional visualization tool.
  One of my favorite, but more challenging and time-consuming pieces of this project, was adjusting the design aspect of the app. Combining UX and UI features to achieve a nice-looking, but effective app proved to be difficult. It seemed like there were always new adjustments to make, or text boxes I couldn't get the size right of. 
  I think that adjusting the structure and layout of my app was one of the most complex topics. At first, I had big plans for the dashboard and realized how assigning space in Dash actually works, and how to make my app look the most visually appealing. Once I adjusted a couple of pieces, it became a lot easier to do things like add padding or change width and height sizes.
  In the same way, customizing the style and theme of my app required some learning. I loved using a bootstrap stylesheet. It made my design process a lot easier. Centering and resizing text, adjusting font and background colors, and importing images all made my app come to life and look more put together.
